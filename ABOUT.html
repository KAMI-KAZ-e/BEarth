	<p class="para">Waste Management In a densely populated country like India, waste management is an issue which stands unresolved. Using technology, we aim to solve the same and “BUILD FOR INDIA”.</p>
	<div class="date"><h2>Inspiration</h2></div>
	<p>To improve upon and optimize the garbage collection & disposal methods carried upon in our country.</p>
<p>To reduce the amount of wastes piled up in the dump yards by efficiently utilizing the wastes.</p>
<p>To involve the company and a third party to carry out this whole ideation, henceforth increasing employment and user incentives.</p>

	<div class="date"><h2>Overview</h2></div>
	
	<p class="para">A website to make the users collaboratively manage waste in different communities such as household, offices, markets etc. Such communities can connect with those industries which can turn waste into raw/usable materials, thus converting waste material into usable components. </p>

<p>The idea is to automate the waste collection and waste reusability process through the website. The different types of wastes are segregated at community levels such as plastic waste from markets and public places, organic waste and newspaper waste from households, specific liquid/solid/gaseous waste from industries. These wastes can be chosen by various types of industries, communities to be utilized efficiently. Therefore, instead of dumping of waste to another area, we propose to deliver waste to those who require it. Hence, reducing the overall waste generated.</p>
